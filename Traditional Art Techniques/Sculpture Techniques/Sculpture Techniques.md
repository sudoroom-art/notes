# Sculpture Techniques

Sculpture is a three-dimensional art form that involves the manipulation of materials to create physical forms and structures. Some common sculpture techniques are:

1. **[[Carving]]**: Removing material from a solid block (e.g., wood, stone, marble) to reveal a form or figure.
2. **[[Modeling]]**: Shaping soft, malleable materials (e.g., clay, wax, plaster) into a desired form or structure.
3. **[[Casting]]**: Pouring liquid material (e.g., molten metal, plaster) into a mold and allowing it to harden, then removing the mold to reveal the finished sculpture.
4. **[[Assemblage]]**: Combining various found or fabricated materials to create a three-dimensional artwork.
