# Printmaking Techniques

Printmaking is the process of creating multiple original artworks by transferring images from one surface to another. Some common printmaking techniques include:

1. **[[Relief printing]]**: Carving a design into a surface (e.g., woodblock, linoleum) and applying ink to the raised areas to create an impression on paper.
2. **[[Intaglio printing]]**: Etching or engraving a design into a metal plate, filling the grooves with ink, and transferring the image onto paper using pressure.
3. **[[Lithography]]**: Drawing a design onto a flat stone or metal plate with a grease-based material, then applying ink and pressing the image onto paper.
4. **[[Screen printing]]**: Forcing ink through a mesh screen with a stencil to create an image on various surfaces, including paper, fabric, and metal.
