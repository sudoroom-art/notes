# [[Pop Art]]

Pop Art was an art movement that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, characterized by its use of popular culture imagery, bold colors, and mass-produced objects. Pop artists, such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, sought to challenge traditional ideas of fine art by blurring the boundaries between high and low culture.
