Cubism was an innovative art movement that emerged in the early 20th century, pioneered by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Cubist artworks are characterized by their fragmented forms, geometric shapes, and multiple viewpoints, challenging traditional ideas of perspective and representation.
