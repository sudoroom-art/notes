# [[Romanticism]]

Romanticism was an artistic movement that emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a reaction to the rationalism of the Enlightenment. Romantic art is characterized by its emphasis on emotion, imagination, and the sublime, often depicting dramatic landscapes, heroic figures, and scenes of passion.
