# [[Shaders]]

Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and are responsible for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, such as visual effects, textures, and lighting. They play a crucial role in defining the appearance of digital art, video games, and visualizations. This section covers various topics related to shaders, including the different types of shaders, how shaders can be defined and used, and the tools and resources available for creating shaders.

## Types of Shaders

There are several types of shaders, each serving a specific purpose in the graphics pipeline:

1. **[[Vertex Shader|Vertex shaders]]**: These shaders process individual vertices and determine their position, color, and other attributes. They are often used to apply transformations, such as scaling, rotation, and translation, to 3D models.

2. **[[Fragment Shader|Fragment (or pixel) shaders]]**: These shaders determine the final color of individual pixels on the screen. They are responsible for applying textures, lighting, and other visual effects to the rendered image.

3. **[[Geometry Shader|Geometry shaders]]**: These shaders can generate new geometry, such as points, lines, or triangles, based on existing vertices. They are useful for creating complex shapes, particle systems, and other procedural effects.

4. **[[Tesselation Shader|Tessellation shaders]]**: These shaders are used to subdivide and refine geometry, resulting in smoother, more detailed surfaces. They are often used in conjunction with displacement maps to add fine details to 3D models.

5. **[[Compute Shader|Compute shaders]]**: These shaders are designed for general-purpose computing tasks that can be parallelized and executed on the GPU. They are used for a wide range of applications, including physics simulations, image processing, and machine learning.

## Defining and Using Shaders

Shaders are typically written in a specialized language, such as [[GLSL]] (OpenGL Shading Language) or [[HLSL]] (High-Level Shading Language), which is similar to C/C++. They are then compiled and linked to the main application or game engine, where they are executed as part of the rendering pipeline.

To use shaders in a project, artists and developers need to follow these general steps:

1. **Write the shader code**: Create shader files (e.g., `.vert` for vertex shaders, `.frag` for fragment shaders) using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). Write the shader code in GLSL, HLSL, or another shading language, depending on the target platform and graphics API.

2. **Compile and link the shaders**: Compile the shader files using a shader compiler, such as the one included with the graphics API (e.g., OpenGL, DirectX) or a third-party tool. Link the compiled shaders to the main application or game engine, and ensure that they are properly loaded and executed during runtime.

3. **Pass data to the shaders**: Provide the shaders with the necessary data, such as vertex positions, textures, and lighting information, using uniform variables, attribute variables, and other data structures. Set up the appropriate rendering pipeline and configure the graphics API to use the shaders when rendering the scene.

## Shader Creation Tools and Resources

There are numerous tools and resources available for creating and experimenting with shaders, including:

- **ShaderToy**: An online platform for creating, sharing, and exploring shaders written in GLSL.
- **Unity ShaderLab**: A Unity-specific shading language that combines Cg/HLSL and a custom syntax for creating shaders in the Unity game engine.
- **Godot Shader Language**: A GLSL-like language for creating shaders in the Godot game engine.
- **The Book of Shaders**: An online resource that provides an introduction to
