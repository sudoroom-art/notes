# [[Neural Networks in Art]]

Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence that can be trained to recognize patterns, make decisions, and generate new content. In the context of art, neural networks can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Generating original artwork based on a dataset of existing images
- Recognizing and classifying different artistic styles and techniques
- Creating dynamic, interactive installations that respond to user input or environmental data
