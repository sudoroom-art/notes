# [[AI-Assisted Design Tools]]

Several AI-assisted design tools, including free services and open-source projects, have emerged to help artists save time while maintaining their artistic creativity and customization.

- [[Stable Diffusion]](https://github.com/openai/stablediffusion): An open-source project that implements a generative model for creating high-quality images. With custom settings and input data, artists can generate diverse visual outputs, making it a versatile tool for generative art.
- [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/): Provides an easy-to-use interface for working with machine learning models, offering a wide range of pre-built models for various creative applications.

- [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/): An AI model by OpenAI that generates images from textual descriptions, enabling artists to explore unique visual interpretations of their ideas.


- [Magenta Studio](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio): A collection of open-source tools built on TensorFlow, designed to help artists create music, drawings, and other forms of art using machine learning.

- [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/): A JavaScript library that simplifies the use of machine learning in creative projects. It provides an accessible interface to work with pre-trained models, including image synthesis, style transfer, and more.

These tools not only make generative art and AI more accessible but also offer artists a range of possibilities to experiment with and incorporate into their creative practice.
