# [[Style Transfer]]

Style transfer is a technique in which the visual style of one image is applied to another, often using deep learning algorithms. This allows artists to create new, unique artwork by combining the content of one image with the style of another. Some popular style transfer applications and tools include:

- [[DeepArt.io]]: An online tool that allows users to create style transfers using pre-trained models or custom styles.
- [[NeuralStyler]]: A free, open-source application for creating style transfers on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
