# [[Overview of Generative Art]]

At the core of generative art is the use of algorithms and mathematical functions to define rules, structures, and behaviors that guide the creation of an artwork. The artist designs the algorithm and sets the parameters, allowing the system to generate the final output with varying degrees of randomness and complexity.
